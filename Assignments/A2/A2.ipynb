    "Nominal\n",
    "--\n",
    "> Mode:\n",
    ">> 1. Definition: In a given set, which value occurs most frequently.\n",
    ">> 2. Why?: Nominal values are inherently characteristic values that have distinctess. Simply a set of values which are allowed to describe a feature. They are discrete, finite sets with no concept of order. Counting occurrences of such data types are one of the few numeric operations which nominals can map/reduce with, and thus are perfect for mode.\n",
    ">> 3. Examples:\n",
    ">>> - Zip Codes: In what area are the majority of our shoppers from?\n",
    ">>> - Employee ID: Which employee had the highest number of sales last month?\n",
    ">>> - Eye Color: What is the most common eye color in each European nation?\n",
    ">>> - Sex: What is the most common sex in a list of given professions?\n",
    ">>\n",
    "> Entropy:\n",
    ">> 1. Definition: The measure of uncertainty of an outcome.\n",
    ">> 2. Why?: Entropy provides a distribution for possible outcomes in a set. For set where permutation is irrelevant, entropy is a way to determine likelihood of an option in comparison to its peers.\n",
    ">> 3. Examples:\n",
    ">>> - Zip Codes: What is it likely that someone in from neighborhood _X_ has cable?\n",
    ">>> - Employee ID: Which branches are most apt to have married employees?\n",
    ">>> - Eye Color: Are those with green eyes prone to skin cancer?\n",
    ">>> - Sex: What is the gender breakdown (percentage) across majors?\n",
    ">>\n",
    "> Contingency Correlation:\n",
    ">> 1. Definition: The measure of association between features.\n",
    ">> 2. Why?: This operation can help visualize/quantify how likely lose within one group belong to another. For example, given the set of baseball players who are left-handed throwers what is their primary position? You would find a low percentage of positions {2, 4, 5, 6} would throw left-handed, with a high spike in {1, 3}.\n",
    ">> 3. Examples:\n",
    ">>> - Zip Codes: What percentage of residents of {zip0, zip1, zip2} are in each income bracket?\n",
    ">>> - Employee ID: What is the commute distribution for employees in {branch0, branch1, ..., branch_n}: 0-15min, 15-30min, 30-60min, 60+?\n",
    ">>> - Eye Color/Sex: What percentage of females surveyed have blue eyes?"
